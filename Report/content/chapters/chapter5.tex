\section{Work distribution and transparency}
\label{chap:work_distribution}

\subsection{Work distribution}
The workload for this project was divided among the group members as follows:

\begin{description}[style=multiline, leftmargin=5cm, font=\bfseries]
    
    \item[Ibrahim El Mankouri]
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label=$\cdot$, noitemsep]
        \item Salome-Meca modeling (front \& rear springs)
        \item Drafting spring modeling sections (sections \ref{sec:front_spring_model} \& \ref{sec:rear_spring_model})
        \item Analysis of numerical results (section \ref{chap:results})
    \end{itemize}

    \item[Ibrahima Sow]
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label=$\cdot$, noitemsep]
        \item Preliminary study modeling (section \ref{sec:plate_model})
        \item Drafting of theoretical framework \& discussion (section \ref{chap:discussion})
        \item Drafting introduction
    \end{itemize}

    \item[Maximilien Zarioh]
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label=$\cdot$, noitemsep]
        \item Python FE solver development
        \item Salome-to-Python integration
        \item Code verification \& validation (part II - section \ref{chap:verification})
        \item Final report structure \& \LaTeX\ formatting
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{description}

\subsection{Use of generative AI}
In accordance with the project guidelines regarding the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence, we declare the following:

Generative AI tools were employed exclusively to assist with the structure, clarity, and grammatical correctness of this report. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item AI was used to suggest improvements to sentence structure and vocabulary to ensure a professional academic tone.
    \item AI was used to assist with \LaTeX\ formatting issues.
    \item AI was used to write the \LaTeX\ code for the convergence graphs (Figures \ref{fig:plate_convergence}, \ref{fig:front_spring_convergence}, and \ref{fig:rear_spring_convergence}) based on our results.
\end{itemize}

No part of the Python code implementation was generated by AI. All algorithms, including the element stiffness matrix formulation, assembly procedures, and boundary condition applications, were written manually.
